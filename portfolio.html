                    <p>This is a design I created for my Integrating Writing and Design class. The purpose of this assignment was to redesign the cover of an album. I chose 'depression cherry' by Beach House as it is one of my favorite albums. I liked the idea for the cover art being like hollow pits where the words seem to travel between but remain stuck in that loop as it fits with the overall feel of the album.</p>
